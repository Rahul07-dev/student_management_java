# Student Management System

## Overview

The **Student Management System** is a simple Java application designed to manage and maintain student records efficiently. This project allows users to perform various operations related to student data, such as adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving student details. The system is intended to be a console-based application with a focus on core Java concepts, including object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and collections.

## Features

- **Add New Student**: Add new student records with details like ID, name, age, gender, course, and grades.
- **Update Student Information**: Modify existing student records, including name, course, and grades.
- **Delete Student**: Remove student records from the system.
- **Search Student**: Retrieve student details using their ID or name.
- **Display All Students**: View a list of all students enrolled in the system.
- **File Persistence**: Save and load student data to and from a file to ensure data persistence across sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core application development.
- **File I/O**: To save and retrieve student data.
- **Collections Framework**: For managing lists of student objects.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implementation of classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or higher installed.
- A Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans (optional).
